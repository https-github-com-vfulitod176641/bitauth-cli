# Contribution Guide

Thanks for your interest in contributing to BitAuth CLI! We're excited to work with you.

## Getting Started

Here's some information to help you get started.

### Clone, Install, Link

To install your modified version of BitAuth CLI, use [Yarn link](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/cli/link/):

```sh
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/bitauth/bitauth-cli.git
cd bitauth-cli/
# install dependencies
bitauth install
# replace your global `bitauth` with this project:
yarn link
```

### Package Scripts

The [package scripts in `package.json`](../package.json) include a lot of useful commands, run them with `yarn`:

```sh
# run the tests:
yarn test
# automatically fix formatting, tslint errors:
yarn fix
# etc.
```

### Oclif CLI Framework

We use the [Oclif CLI framework](https://oclif.io/docs/introduction), check out their documentation to get up to speed quickly.

### Debugging Commands

You can debug commands using the `$DEBUG` environment variable. Set it to the scope you're interested in, or use `*` for full logging.

```sh
# full logging:
env DEBUG=\* bitauth init --help
# filter by `bitauth`:
env DEBUG="bitauth" bitauth init --help
```

### Update Autocomplete

First, follow the regular instructions from `bitauth autocomplete`. If you make changes to the CLI which must change the autocomplete, simple re-run:

```sh
# regenerate completions
bitauth autocomplete:script
```

You can ignore the output; the completions will be regenerated in-place.

### If Something Isn't Updating

Delete the `oclif.manifest.json`, since it will be used if present. (It was generated by the `prepack` script.)
