  public static readonly description = `start the repo-pruning assistant

This command is an interactive assistant which helps to reduce your Git repository size by migrating to new \`artifacts\` and \`deploy\` branches. With the old branches not in use, they can be safely deleted.

This process is designed to avoid overwriting history. This makes it much easier to thin down a repo â€“ even with a large, distributed set of contributors. As contributors check out the updated configuration, they will automatically begin using the new, lighter-weight branch. They can then delete or archive the branches containing old, unused artifacts.`;
