This command provides a convenient method for running the given package script inside Docker.

This is useful for projects which use native dependencies but don't yet have a way to ensure consistency across development environments.

Because artifacts are locked down, reviewed, and signed, if a project contributor is using a platform for development which is not supported by the signed native binaries (e.g. macOS or Windows), they may need to run those binaries in a Linux Container. Docker is a very performant option, and guarantees reproducibility across development environments.

Note, this should never be used in a Linux environment (e.g. production) â€“ since Linux should already be supported by any native code in your reviewed artifacts.`;
